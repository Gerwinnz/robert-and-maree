					<h1>Details &amp; Accomodation</h1>
					<p>We thought we would give you an update on the 2015 McConnell/van Royen Wedding.  Maree and Bob are planning on sending out "Save the Date" invitations in the next couple of months for their wedding which will be at Lake Tekapo on Saturday 4th April 2015.</p>

					<p>As this is Easter, accommodation may be in demand and we have been advised to book early as guests often book Easter to Easter.  We are arriving in Tekapo on Thursday 2nd April and departing Monday the 6th April.  We will be staying at Peppers Bluewater Resort which is where the reception is to be held.</p>

					<p>Both Maree and Bob are hoping that if you are there on the Friday you may like to join us for dinner at Reflections Restaurant (at own expense) with the meal being an early sitting beginning around 5.30/6.00pm.  You are also more than welcome to join us at Peppers for a buffet breakfast on the Sunday at 9.30am (at own cost if not staying at Peppers).</p>

					<p><strong>Please see below for recommended accommodation: </strong></p>

							</ul>
							<p>Discover Tekapo have a number of houses both on the Peppers side of town and on the other side of the bridge.  Their website is the best place to start.  </p>
							<p>They range in price from $170 for two adults (plus $30 for additional adults and $20 for children), to $400 for four adults (plus $40 for extras).  Some can sleep 12 and are great for groups.  As it is Easter you will need to book a minimum of 3 nights.</p>
							<p>Prue Blake is happy to be contacted via email directly to find the best options.  She has also advised that some gorgeous houses are Hillcrest Lodge A and B (22 Sibbald Lane).</p>
							<p>The Holiday Park is also another option for guests (http://www.laketekapo-accommodation.co.nz/lake-tekapo-campground/),and the Chalet Boutique Motel is highly rated in customer reviews (http://www.thechalet.co.nz/).</p>  

							<p>*It is strongly recommended that you avoid booking the Godley Hotel - it is God awful.</p>
